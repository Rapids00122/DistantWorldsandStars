# The **Milky** Way

In the vast cosmic expanse that makes up the Milky Way galaxy, a dark and eerie disquiet permeates from the endless silent expanse, like a foreboding whisper echoing throught the void. Amidst the endless swirling of the spiral arms of the galaxy, countless stars and planets dot the plane. A ballet of cosmic perportions is performed daily as celestial bodies drift in and out in enigmatic harmony. The Milky Way is 100,000 light-years in diameter comprising 100 to 400 billion stars, including our own. Dark matter, an elusive and mysterious substance that permiates all corners of the galaxt and exerts its gravitational influence on all the suns and planets. At the center of it all lies a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A, whose presense evokes both fascination and apprehension. With a mass of close to 4 millions suns, the black hole at the center of everything stands alone with its unedning appetite for all matter. This galaxy is the home of the only know sentient species: the Human race.
